# Muzz 

Muzz is a real-time audio analyzer for inspecting the contents of live sound and music audio files.
The purpose of Muzz is to help analyze an audio signal to understand the characteristics of this signal (fundamental, harmonics, feedback, etc.), to describe the source/room/receiver behavior. This is achieved by providing a set of above 20 different spectrum analyzers to visualize audio data.
This app can be very useful to analyze and equalize the audio response of a hall, or for educational purposes, and more. The Muzz spectrum analyzer is up to any challenge. Whether simple outdoor or indoor frequency monitoring, we got it!

There are above 20 different spectrum graph types for running your audio analysis. Here is a short explanation about few of them:

## Spectrum: This Visualization view renders a visualization of the simple one-dimensional spectrum (using a mean-square amplitude scale) of the music.
## LinearOAS: This Visualization that shows an amplitude vs. exponential-frequency spectrum of the audio waveform. The horizontal axis covers a total of 6 octaves.
## EllipticalOAS: This visualization generates the same FFT spectral information and displays it as a series of concentric ellipses instead of as rows in a Cartesian grid. 
## Cymbal:  This visualization is inspired by contemplating the vibrational patterns of a cymbal.
OutOfTheRabbitHole:  This visualization renders the time-history of the music's spectrum across a sequence of circles.

Features included: 
### Play and Pause button for audio files.
### Enable mic for real time audio analysis.
### Peak enhance and algorithm setup/
### Visualization gain at the treble.
### Dark and light mode.

## Play / Pause 
When clicked it stops the music playback and freezes the visualization display. When clicked again, the music playback and visual display will continue.
 
## Mic
When clicked the app starts live audio mode from the device microphone and starts the selected visualization. Another click on the Mic button will end the live audio and start again the playback mode.

## Folder
When clicked, a sub-window pops up to allow selection of an audio file to play from the current device. On Mac it allows you to select a file from your own Music folder. In iPad you can access only files from your iCloud drive folder. This is since Apple allows only its own music app to have access to songs in the iPad music library.
 
## Peak enhancer
When clicked, it passes the audio signal through a filter which enhances the display of spectral lines, mostly the harmonic of musical notes and reduces display of noise such as percussive effects. Another click will remove this filter.
 
## Visualization Algorithm Option
There are several variations available for producing visual spectrum analysis. By clicking this button, each graph will display another optional data added. For example, adding delay on Spectrum Bars graph. Delay is helpful for examining the visual data more carefully. In many graphs this option button is adding visual data or another variation of showing the spectrum. 
 
## Dark mode
When clicked it changes the spectrum background mode to light or dark mode. By default the background is set to dark mode. Some visualizations look much better in a certain mode, therefore it is advised to try this option on your selected spectrum graph.

## Visualization Gain and Visualization Treble
Sliding these controls left and right will adjust the gain and the slope of the visual data. They will not change the audio level but subjectively enhance the display to get better focused data if needed.
