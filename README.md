# XCleaner 

Cleans quickly and easily folders Xcode heavily uses and purges tons of space from your Mac.

## Clean Derived Data files
Easy and short way to clean the derived data folder with XCleaner. Instead of opening the folder yourself, XCleaner will do this for you easily and delete all files from the Derived Data folder. That will not affect your project work. The contents of Derived Data will be recreated when you build your project again.

## Clean Device Logs
The iOS Device Logs folder contains old device logs for various versions of iOS. If you don’t need to store these files it is warmly advised to clean this folder as it tends to get huge.

## Clean Archives
After you archive your project, a folder is created for each archive. Usually there is no need to store these archives, unless you need to use a dSYM file to symbolicate a crash.
